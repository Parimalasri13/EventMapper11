The diversity of research projects undertaken is a measure of IITK's strong track record of research. Here are some highlights. Innovations on COVID-19 Innovations on COVID-19 Aerospace Engineering Biological Sciences And Bioengineering Civil Engineering Chemical Engineering Chemistry Computer Science and Engineering Earth Sciences Electrical Engineering Humanities & Social Sciences Management Sciences Mathematics Mechanical Engineering Materials Science & Engineering Physics Inter-disciplinary Screening Ttechnology for COVID-19 Screening Technology developed at NCFlexE for COVID-19 HITES, “A handheld Infrared thermometer with enhanced safety” developed at NCFlexE, IIT Kanpur enables temperature scanning to be carried out while maintaining 6 ft physical distance. Positive Pressure Respirator System Positive Pressure Respirator System Prof. Nachiketa Tiwari, Department of Mechanical Engineering, IIT Kanpur and Prof Devendra Gupta, In-charge, Covid-19 ICU (SGPGI) have developed a working prototype of a Positive Pressure Respirator System. The PPRS system addresses the problem of the acute global scarcity of N95 respirators, which are a critical component of PPE Kits. It is a safer alternative to the N95 respirator as it provides uncontaminated air and isolates the health professionals from the exposure to the virus. It can be built fairly quickly, using local resources & in large numbers. Disinfection chamber: Two-stage Innovative Process for Human Disinfection for Controlled Access Disinfection chamber: Two-stage Innovative Process for Human Disinfection for Controlled Access IIT Kanpur has successfully implemented a low cost rapid disinfectant process at our Health Centre for the outsiders coming to campus to sanitize anyone (external disinfection) under the guidance of Profs. Manindra Agrawal and Deepu Philip. The process aims to achieve a high rate of personnel disinfection within 2 minutes. Local hospitals and district administration have approached us to implement this at strategic locations in Kanpur. Majority of the approaches of individual disinfection process focuses on exposing human touch surfaces like fingers, hand, etc. to soap based solutions and covering faces with masks to prevent droplet-based spread. However, residual germs residing on clothes, sleeves, masks, etc. are not eliminated by this process. This proposal focuses on innovatively combining two common disinfection approaches followed across the world to achieve a new and cost-effective disinfection process that is safe for human beings. Autonomous Robotic UVC hospital room disinfection system with sensor navigation with an option for Manual affordable UV disinfection systems Autonomous Robotic UVC hospital room disinfection system with sensor navigation with an option for Manual affordable UV disinfection systems Dr. Sheetal Katyayani, Director, TruSpectra India Private Limited have developed Autonomous Robotic UVC hospital room disinfection system with sensor navigation with an option for Manual affordable UV disinfection systems. Autonomous Robotic Disinfection system designed to disifect the Hospital room without human intervention with built in navigation sensor to achieve 4LOG level of disinfection in less than 30 minutes for room size of 45m3. UVC disinfection (UVCD) robot to disinfect the entire internal hospital room geometry. TruSpectra UVC system is designed for max 6m diameter room and max time for disinfection is 30 minutes. UVCD is designed based on C.D as spore. COVID-19, Virus and bacteria shall take far less time than C.D (Clostridium Difficile). Use of pedestal roller wheel wall panel / capsule to cover the patients Robotic cleaning mob (designed for peracetic acid / glutaraldehyde) with spraying, mobbing and wiping to safeguard other patients, doctors, nurses and healthcare workers. Option for manual affordable system (without robotics, Lithium Ion Battery system, LIDAR sensor and PLC) to reduce the cost. PIPES Kit PIPES Kit Spread of COVID-19 has resulted in a huge demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) for workers in essential services exposed to high-risk environments. As standard PPE kits become scarce, there is a need for low-cost and mass producible alternatives that provide protection for the entire body. A team of researchers led by Dr. Nitin Gupta & industry partners based on thin cylindrical rolls/pipes of polyethylene, which is non-porous & commonly used in the industry for packaging & making plastic-bags. Polythene material makes airtight and will provide required protection. It can be easily mass manufactured and transported at scale. The technology is made open source for anybody to make it. Easy to scale, cost effective and relevant particularly as imported kits are difficult to get. VSV based live attenuated recombinant vaccine against Novel Coronavirus infectionsystems Vaccine: VSV based live attenuated recombinant vaccine against Novel Coronavirus infectionsystems Dr. Dibyendu Kumar Das, Department of Biological Sciences and Bioengineering, IIT Kanpur and his team have aimed to develop replication-competent vaccines against Novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) based on attenuated recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) vectors expressing the novel corona virus spike (s) glycoprotein (rVSV-SARS-CoV- 2S). Vaccines, designed on live attenuated recombinant VSV template have been highly effective in animal models and are particularly appealing because they can be administered mucosally. Additionally, VSV rarely infect human and the chance of infection due to VSV is negligible. Recently, recombinant VSV based Ebola virus, Marburg virus and Lassa virus vaccine has been developed and tested effective in nonhuman primates model. The rVSV-ZEBOV-GP vaccine against Ebola had been 97.5% effective at stopping Ebola transmission, relative to no vaccination, approved by WHO in 2019 for vaccination. Indigenous Invasive Ventilator solution Indigenous Invasive Ventilator solution Mr. Nikhil Kurele, CEO, Nocca Robotics have aimed to develop Indigenous Invasive Ventilator solution with following features: -Modular design, high end ventilator suitable for COVID-19 patients -Rapidly manufacturable at large scale across India -Low Power -Pessure and Volume Control -Versatile operations: works with both medical air / ambient air + oxygen -Safe invasive and non-invasive ventilatory modes -IoT-based system to create a Ventilator Management System -Remotely control & monitor multiple ventilators remotely with one IoT device -Inlet filter to prevent viral entry in the circuit -Expiratory flow filter to contain the viral load -Microprocessor-based with active exhalation -Automatic calibration system on startup -Easy transition from invasive to noninvasive ventilation Contact tracing and fake news verification App Contact tracing and fake news verification App Dr. Swaprava Nath, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kanpur and his team have developed a app of Contact tracing and fake news verification App. The users of social media apps like WhatsApp or Twitter can easily check whether a news received is fake or not (in a much simpler manner than the usual apps). What makes our solution stand out from the other such detectors is that the checking methodology is extremely simple. The users do not need to open a different app or google the news to find this out, it will happen by just forwarding the message to a saved contact. The ease of use is the biggest impact that this project wants to create for fake news detection. This can be used with non-smart phone also and thus deployable in areas of limited telecom connectivity.

Modeling of COVID-19 Modeling of COVID-19 Interesting work on modeling of COVID-19 by Prof Mahendra K Verma and his team from IIT Kanpur. The work demonstrates power law growth in spread of COVID-19. Entire research paper is available. Read More... Preventive and cost-effective surface coating medicated masks and medical wear Preventive and cost-effective surface coating medicated masks and medical wear A team led by Profs. Nagma Parveen, M.L.N Rao Ashish K Patra from the Department of Chemistry have been granted funding from DST/SERB for developing a preventive and cost-effective surface coating. This coating will be applied in making medicated masks and medical wear (personal protective equipment, PPE) as a preventive measure for COVID-19, in particular, for doctors and nurses who are susceptible to contamination while treating infected patients. The idea is based on a combination of anti-microbial polymer coating and functionalized virucidal drugs/agents to attain a synergistic anti-viral effect. The team aims to develop a basic prototype within three months and further, collaborate with potential industrial and/or start-up partners for its potential large-scale applications. N95 face mask N95 face mask A team of researchers led by Profs J.Ramkumar & Tarun Gupta and alumnus Sandip Patil are working on a protective face mask which is equivalent to N95 face mask for the front line medical staff and common man fighting against COVID-19. The primary goal is to test various available filter media and develop a low-cost protective respirator which is equivalent or even better than N95. We have to quickly set up a filter testing rig equipped with an aerosol laser spectrometer and identify a non-woven polypropylene based 3-4 layer material as the likely candidate to make such mask. Its efficiency must be equal to N95 and it offers much lower resistance to the air passage. Scalability:After identifying the appropriate material the mask will be made manual because the ultrasonic welding machine and automatic manufacturing machines are also a bottleneck at this lock down period. We will identity few profession stitches who have prior experience in textile and mask fabrication. Initially for few days we would be able to manufacturing 500 piece/day. Slowly we will ramp up the production to 2000/day. Portable Ventilators Portable Ventilators Prof. Amitabha Bandopadhyaya of Bioscience and Bioengineering Department, IIT Kanpur is coordinating an effort led by a large team for rapid development and production of portable ventilators which will be life saving for COVID-19 patients, particularly the elderly. Anti Viral Nasal Filter Anti Viral Nasal Filter Mr. Ravi Pandey from SIIC at IIT Kanpur has developed an Anti Viral Nasal filter, the need for this filter arise considering the recent outbreak of corona virus, where the main channel of transmission occurs by the transfer of droplets to a healthy person through air. There have been several similar outbreaks that utilize air as the main transmission channel. However, such transmission of diseases can be stopped using different filters for mouth and nose. Since 90% of the breathing occurs through nasal cavity only, hence nasal passage is the main source of contamination. The existing masks comprise different straps to hold on to the face of the user and are uncomfortable to wear during different activities of the day. There was a need for a filter that filters the nano particles including any viruses with high filtration efficiency. The present invention minimizes the leakage of air, that occurs from sides while wearing a N95 mask, without maintaining positive pressure inside the filter.

Molecules in liquids and gases move randomly; there is an average distance between two nearest molecules. This distance is used to model the properties of the gas. However, there are certain problems, like turbulence, that cannot be solved using just the distance, which is a single scale. We need to consider all scales from large to small. Such systems are called multiscale systems.Read More... New way to determine arrow of time One of the annoying side effects of being absorbed in a gripping novel is that the cup of tea on the table becomes cold! Unfortunately, the tea would not heat itself by absorbing the heat around it, just as pieces of a broken egg would not put themselves together or milk mixed in coffee would not separate by itself. Such things are irreversible, and define a fixed direction of time—that from the past towards the future. This apparent progression of time is called the ‘arrow of time’.Read More...
